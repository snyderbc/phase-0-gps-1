What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session? Merging locally vs. updating the master - when you have to sync, etc. I also was very confused by how merge conflicts could be resolved.
What concepts were clarified during the GPS? Both of the above!
What questions did you ask your pair and the guide? My pair had to cancel so it was just the guide. I asked some questions related to pushing, pulling, and merging. Also some basic command line formatting / editing questions.
What still confuses you about Git? I think I'm still struggling a bit with understanding when to update the master locally vs. when just to push everything to GitHub, and then pull it in. I think I get it...but we'll see!
How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS? N/A - my pair had to cancel. But I treated it as a solo challenge and enjoyed getting to ask my guide questions!
